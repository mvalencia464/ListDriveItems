# ListDriveItems
Use Apps Script to list out all items in a Google Drive folder.

USE CASE: If you need to reference lots of images in your Google Drive folder, you can easily use this script. You will end up with a spreadsheet with the filenames in one column and the unique URL for the image in another column. I used it to create thousands of images for scheduling a year's worth of social media content in a single day.

HOW TO USE IT:

1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Click on "Extensions" in the menu bar, then "Apps Script"
3. Paste the code from "Script" that you downloaded above
4. Replace 'your-folder' to the name of the folder you want to list. (i.e., 'Example Folder').
5. Click "Save"
6. It should automatically create a new spreadsheet with the two columns and if there are images, all the unique URLs assigned by Google Drive.

Enjoy!
